== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to create a POWr Account? =

= How do I add Social Feed to a page or blog post? =
Create and save the plugin in your WP Dashboard.  Then copy and paste the unique shortcode into any page or post. You can continue editing the plugin on your live page, in your WP Dashboard, or by logging in to www.powr.io.

= How do I add Social Feed to a theme? =
In your WP Dashboard, select Appearance > Widgets from the left sidebar. Find Social Feed under Available Widgets and drag it into a sidebar or footer.  Then visit the live page to set up the plugin.

You can then edit and save a new version, and paste the new unique shortcode into a page or post.

= Will my users see the Edit button above Social Feed? =
